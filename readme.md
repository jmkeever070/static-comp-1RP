# Static-Comp-1 

This is my Static Comp 1 challenge web design.

# What is it?

This page is the second project for Turing MOD 1 students.

# What is the objective?

This is a project designed for students to continue to improve their basic HTML and CSS skills. The goals are as follows:

To have a responsive, basic static site with index.html and styles.css.
Site should work on Firefox, Safari, and Chrome.
Must use normalize in CSS instead of a reset file.
Flex-box was allowed for use on this project.

# How it was made

Created with a combination of HMTL and CSS

# Coding Style

Standard HTML and CSS

# Media Queries

I set media queries at at 799px, 739px and 490px. At these sizes the articles will adjust their width to 29%, 41%, and 83%. Also at 490px the header, classes of nav-links, fa-calender-alt, top-corner, heels and ID of admin-user will adjust display, text-size, padding and alignment.

# Challenges

There were some issues when resizing to a smaller screen. Some of the classes in the navigation bar were extremely difficult to get them where I wanted them, possibly due to inheriting.
